Quantum Convolution with Groupwise Kernels, Stride, and Feature Pooling for Feature Extraction


This has been achieved as a result of a comprehensive examination of quantum convolution (QuC) for image processing, to enhance both computational efficiency and image quality. The paper demonstrates that it is now possible to address the challenge of integrating classical convolutional methods into the quantum domain, which is a crucial step in optimizing the potential of quantum computing for image-processing applications. The primary goal would be to provide a taxonomy for the categorization of quantum images. After that, resource-efficient QuC neural networks (QCNNs) utilizing cutting-edge methods like pre-padding, quantum padding, and quantum Fourier transforms would be introduced. QuC procedures would be performed on image datasets such as MNIST, Lenna, and Pepper as part of the technique. It would be based on the mathematical expressions of procedures such as feature extraction, batch normalization (BN), padding, and stride. Tensor networks, controlled rotation, and quantum kernels would provide the foundation for the aforementioned processes. The tensor notation and equations presented here would be sufficient for the accurate application of the mentioned methods in quantum contexts. The main conclusions of this work show that using QCNNs instead of traditional CNN models significantly improves both the computing efficiency and accuracy of the classification problem at hand. The paper describes how sophisticated quantum operations improve feature extraction and thus increase the bar for image processing efficiency. These operations include quantum factorization and its inverse, pre-padding, and QuC with various kernels. The findings essentially demonstrate that QuC techniques will fundamentally alter the field of image processing and have further uses in machine learning and quantum computing.
